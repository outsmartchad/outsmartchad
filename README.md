### Yooo

I build trading infrastructure and developer tools on Solana. I care about speed, reliability, and giving traders an edge — whether they're human or AI agents.

My work sits at the intersection of **DeFi** and **AI agents**. I've built tools used by hundreds of traders and contributed to core Solana ecosystem SDKs.

#### What I'm building

**Trading Infrastructure**

- [outsmart-cli](https://github.com/outsmartchad/outsmart-cli) — CLI for trading on Solana. 18 DEX adapters, 12 SWQoS TX landing processors. Buy, sell, LP, snipe, create pools from your terminal. **565+ stars**
- [outsmart-agent](https://github.com/outsmartchad/outsmart-agent) — Autonomous trading infrastructure for AI agents on Solana — LP sniping, farming, trenching, devving coins, Polymarket bets, and an MCP server so agents can earn to stay alive
- [pumpswap-sdk](https://github.com/outsmartchad/pumpswap-sdk) — PumpSwap AMM SDK with Jito, Nozomi, 0slot, BlockRazor, bloXroute supported

**Privacy & Confidential DeFi**

- [zodiac-liquidity](https://github.com/outsmartchad/zodiac-liquidity) — Next-gen privacy protocol for onchain liquidity providers and traders. [zodiac-liquidity.app](https://zodiac-liquidity.app/)
- [zodiac-circuits](https://github.com/outsmartchad/zodiac-circuits) — Arcis circuit files powering Zodiac's confidential computation layer

**Developer Tools & Skills**

- [arcium-dev-skill](https://github.com/outsmartchad/arcium-dev-skill) — Claude Code skill for building privacy-preserving Solana programs with Arcium MPC
- [agentic-engineering](https://github.com/outsmartchad/agentic-engineering) — Production patterns for agentic systems — multi-agent orchestration, tool-use architecture, MCP integration, eval-driven iteration, and deployment guardrails

**Onchain Programs**

- [solana_onchain_program](https://github.com/outsmartchad/solana_onchain_program) — Solana programs in Rust
- [anchor-programs](https://github.com/outsmartchad/anchor-programs) — Onchain program development with Anchor
- [loan](https://github.com/outsmartchad/loan) — A Cosmos SDK blockchain module for loan transactions
- [tokenfactory](https://github.com/outsmartchad/tokenfactory) — Cosmos SDK module for creating and managing native tokens

---

#### Ecosystem contributions

- [MeteoraAg/damm-v2-sdk](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2-sdk) — TypeScript SDK for interacting with DAMM-V2 on Meteora

---

#### Currently exploring

- Agentic infrastructure — designing multi-agent systems that plan, execute, and self-correct autonomously using tool-use and MCP
- Confidential compute with MPC and FHE
- MCP servers for Solana tooling
